## phyloTAGs

A previous survey of Colombians (de la Cuesta et al 2018 Scie. Rep) found enrichment of members of the families  Lachnospirace and Ruminococcaceae, and a contrasting association between their diversity and abundance with cardiometabolic risk: while Lachnospiracea showed correlation with high risk, Ruminococcacea did with low risk. These results led to the question whether markers of less conserved genes could help gain better resolution of the diversity within these families
We used primers to amplify the less conserved genes dna Kinase1 and gyraseB. Here we present the steps for a microbial community analysis using these markers. The steps include:

1) Trimming (trimmomatic add commands)
2) Assemble (Flash, add commands)
3) Denoising (deblur and dada2)
4) Classification (Struo)
5) Diversity analysis (phyloseq) and Differential abundance (Deseq2)
  i) script for pre-processing (phylotags_preprocessing.R): read files, load GTDB table and create phyloseq object
  ii) script for diversity analysis (phylotags_diversity.R): alpha-diversity 
  iii) script for plots (phylotags_plots.R)
